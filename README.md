# Pong

Pong game with game modes like PVP, Bots with 5 levels of difficulty, Campain, Level creator with both PVP mode and vsBots

PVP Mode - Works just like you would imagine, player one moves by W and S player two moves by arrows

Player vs Computer - I implemented 5 levels of difficulty, easy, medium, hard, insane and impossible good luck!

Campain - You have 4 levels in campain with diffrent modificators.

Sandbox/level creation - You have multiple modificators to change apperance, logic, and diffrent values like opponent speed, bacground color, ball size, player paddle size by witch you can create perfect or just fun game for yourself. You can also play with friend! Just pick PVP option and start the game. Player moves by W and S, Opponent(Player two) moves By ArrowUp and Arrow Down!

In levels or custom games where you play againts bots your controls are Arrows (Up & Down)
However in PVP games your controls (Player one) are W and S.
